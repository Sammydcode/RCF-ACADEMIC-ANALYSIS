# RCF Academic Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the academic performance of students in the RCF community using **Python**, **Power BI**, and **Excel**. The goal is to uncover key insights into students' CGPA distribution, departmental performance, and common academic challenges.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Initial data cleaning and structuring.
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook)**: Advanced data analysis and statistical computations.
- **Power BI**: Visual analysis and interactive dashboard creation.

## Objectives
- Identify the **top 10 high-performing** and **low-performing** students across departments.
- Compute the **average CGPA** for each department and the entire student body.
- Rank departments based on **performance** and **number of respondents**.
- Extract the **most common academic issues** faced by students.
- Provide **data-driven insights** to improve academic success.

## Key Findings
- Some departments consistently excel, while others require academic support.
- Common student challenges include **course load, time management, and comprehension difficulties**.
- The overall **average CGPA** of students is **3.131**, which is below the standard RCF benchmark.

## Conclusion
This analysis serves as a strategic tool for making **data-driven decisions** aimed at enhancing academic success across all departments. The insights can help implement **mentorship programs, academic counseling, and tailored tutorials** to support students.
